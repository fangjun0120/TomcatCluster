install and configure ssh

# apt-get install openssh-server

/etc/ssh/sshd_config
use SSH keys instead of password
then only specifically approved computers can connect
# PasswordAuthentication no
restart sshd
# sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
or 
# /etc/init.d/ssh restart

create a private SSH key (on client side)
# ssh-keygen
# default location: /home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa
# enter passphrase: [privatekey]
Generated private key: /home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa
Generated public key: /home/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
copy the public key to remote server and put with path:
# ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Client side
# ssh [user]@192.168.1.xxx
